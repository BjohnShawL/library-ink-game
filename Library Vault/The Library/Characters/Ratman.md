Went into a rich man's library with father to steal valuable books. He had been taught paranoia, and when his father died he amplified that paranoia. Constantly feels like he's being hunted, may believe he's still in that initial library. Tries to capture the protagonist

## Appearance of Library

Dark, shadowy, hanging ropes and old sackcloth. Dusty, tall unsupported stacks of books. Lots of strange silhouettes. Traps abound.  

## Routes
 - Safe route 1 -- [[Player]] doesn't interact with the mystery. [[Ratman]] is a hidden influence, never encountered, but you get to see the effect of them. Some of [[Ratman]]'s story is present. If you encounter him later he sees you as an accomplice, which will draw you into danger. #vamp-til-next-section
 - Unsafe route 1 -- [[Player]] interacts with the mystery, triggering [[Ratman]] to hunt the protag:
	 - [[Player]] falls into trap:
		 - [[Player]] tries to escape the trap. They are taunted by [[Ratman]] but refuse to engage with him. They force themselves into tighter and tighter areas of the stacks, and are eventually crushed by falling books. Last moments are the [[Ratman]] adding another note to their journal - "Today I survived another hunter."
		 - [[Player]] sits in the trap and waits for rescue - loop back
		 - [[Player]] threatens the [[Ratman]]. He leaves, allowing you to escape into :
			 - Safe route 2 -- [[Player]] manages to pull their way slowly and torturously through the fallen rubble and damaged books. If they encounter the [[Ratman]] later he sees them as a threat and will treat you as a revenant. Fear / Hostility #hostile
		 - [[Player]] begs for release / mercy. [[Ratman]] tells them that there is no mercy or release down here, that it would be unkind to let them go. Kills [[Player]]. #player-death 
		 - [[Player]] talks to [[Ratman]] :
			 - Convo 1 - Legitimate claim. [[Ratman]] and his father came here to retrieve the books that demonstrated that they were owed a noble title and heritage. They had been forced into stealing and were now seeking a better way of life. 
				 - Continue -> convo 2
				 - Draw him closer, then rush him, allowing [[Player]] to escape
					 - There is a chase, which either leads onto safe route 2 (slowly and subtly) or culminates in [[Ratman]] being injured, and asking [[Player]] for the mercy of death. 
						 - Yes - [[Ratman]] dies, allowing you to find the journal #dead
						 - No & leave him there - [[Ratman]] is left to scream and curse at you as you walk away into the darkness, the library changing around the [[Player]] (because you have taken on some of his darkness) #dead
						 - No & rescue him - You use the page on [[Medical Treatments]], and [[Edit]] the [[Ratman]], adding information about healing to his journal. He refuses to forgive or trust you, but points you to the exit of his section. #healer 
			 - Convo 2 - Bastards! The actual owner of the library is a man who's forefathers were just big murdery bastards. He has the evidence here, in his journal. Why are they better, why do they deserve more? And who's to say that [[Ratman]] and his father don't deserve the same life of ease and luxury, after all there's nothing to say he's not descended from the same stock:
				 - Agree - [[Edit]] the journal to include a revised family tree, giving [[Ratman]] a noble birth. Leads to death, as [[Ratman]] now sees the [[Player]] as a trespasser in His Domain #player-death
				 - Disagree - [[Ratman]] deserves better than to be noble. Leads to Convo 3
			 - Convo 3 - The root of the matter. Why has he stayed in the library. Where is his father? His father died as the boy ran.  
				 - Information wants to be free. His father's death allowed [[Ratman]] access to the library. [[Edit]] the [[Ratman]] to include the [[manifesto]] / philosophy thing. Good can come of his father's death, because Public libraries are a force for good. [[Player]] is allowed to leave the trap. [[Player]] and [[Ratman]] talk as he escorts them to the edge of his section #firebrand
				 - His father sacrificed himself to allow the boy to run. He can be proud of his father's love for him, and that can be enough. The [[Ratman]] edits his own journal at the [[Player]]'s urging, and the entire section dissolves, leaving [[Player]] sat in a chair, holding the journal of a boy who escaped a library. #jumanji
	 - [[Player]] evades trap and runs - [[Ratman]] follows and there is a chase. Chase culminates in the death of the [[Ratman]]:
		 - [[Player]] leaves the area and we transition to a new area of the library
		 - [[Player]] returns to the corpse of the [[Ratman]], finds the journal which provides a skewed narrative - encoded / misleading / bits missing. Shows a version of the Ratman who owned a library with his father. There are signs that this is a falsehood (As I rode my horse through the library...)
